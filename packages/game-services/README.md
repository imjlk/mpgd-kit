# Game services

Client, contract, backend, and store helpers for authoritative game services.
See [backend integration](../../docs/GAME_SERVICES_BACKEND.md) for the existing
verification and ledger boundaries.

## Optional operation progress

`purchase(input, options?)` and `claimRewardedAd(input, options?)` accept optional
`onProgress` observers. Existing one-argument calls and client doubles remain
compatible. Types are available from `@mpgd/game-services/client` and the package
root. No UI runtime or Phaser dependency is added.

```ts
await client.purchase(input, {
  correlationId: 'view-operation-42',
  onProgress: (event) => updateStatus(event),
  onObserverError: (error) => reportUiObserverError(error),
});
```

| Phase | Observed fact |
| --- | --- |
| `platform-requested` | The platform API request is about to be attempted |
| `platform-result` | The platform API resolved; `status` retains its result code |
| `server-requested` | The request has been constructed and the backend verification/claim call is about to be attempted |
| `server-result` | The backend resolved; `accepted` mirrors verification or claim acceptance |
| `completed` | The local invocation returned a normal result; `status` equals that result's status |
| `exception` | The invocation threw; `at` identifies platform, server, or local processing |

Purchase and rewarded-ad progress are discriminated by `kind` and `phase`.
`sequence` starts at one per invocation and increases for each actual event.
Events are frozen and calls have independent observers, sequences, and optional
correlation IDs. Callback invocation order is deterministic; asynchronous callback
completion order belongs to the callback. There is no event history, polling,
retry, or cancellation mechanism.

A platform request is not proof that a native screen opened, and a server stage
is not proof that it closed. Native UI visibility cannot be inferred from these
events. Platform ad completion/reward flags, backend acceptance, and the final
service result remain separate. Progress is observation, never grant evidence.

Successful verified purchases and claimed ads normally emit all five non-error
stages. Cancelled, pending, failed, skipped, or unavailable platform results
complete without fabricating backend stages. Unsupported targets emit only the
local completed result, retaining existing rejected-result semantics. An
authoritative Microsoft Store completion emits no duplicate verification.
Verse8 purchases preserve the existing Agent8 grant restrictions and pending
semantics. Backend rejection is normal completion; an exception leaves the
outcome uncertain and does not mean the server denied a grant.

Events do not copy receipts, provider evidence, auth headers, player IDs, ledger
IDs, idempotency keys, raw responses, or provider exception details. A correlation
ID is caller-supplied UI/diagnostic metadata: use an opaque, non-sensitive value.
It is independent of the backend idempotency key and confers no grant authority.

Synchronous callback exceptions and rejected callback promises are isolated.
Observer promises are not awaited: slow or unsettled observers cannot delay a
platform call, verification, claim, or business result. Optional `onObserverError`
observes only observation failures; its own exceptions/rejections are consumed.
There is no forced global logging or transport. Original business exceptions
still reject the client promise unchanged. Existing analytics, purchase recovery,
and retry policy are not redesigned by this observer API.

The root `pnpm test` pipeline includes compiled client JS and public declaration
consumption checks alongside the client and target conformance suites.
